# Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder (VVenC)

The Fraunhofer Versatile Video Encoder (VVenC) is a fast and efficient H.266/VVC encoder implementation with the following main features:
- Easy to use encoder implementation with five predefined quality/speed presets;
- Perceptual optimization to improve subjective video quality, based on the XPSNR visual model;
- Extensive frame-level and task-based parallelization with very good scaling;
- Frame-level single-pass and two-pass rate control supporting variable bit-rate (VBR) encoding;
- Expert mode encoder interface available, allowing fine-grained control of the encoding process.

## Build

VVenC uses CMake to describe and manage the build process. A working [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installation is required to build the software. In the following, the basic build steps are described. Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/vvenc/wiki/Build) for the description of all build options.

### How to build using CMake?

To build using CMake, create a `build` directory and generate the project:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. <build options>
```

To actually build the project, run the following after completing project generation:

```sh
cmake --build .
```

For multi-configuration projects (e.g. Visual Studio or Xcode) specify `--config Release` to build the release configuration.

### How to build using GNU Make?

On top of the CMake build system, convinence Makefile is provided to simplify the build process. To build using GNU Make please run the following:

```sh
make install-release <options>
```

Other supported build targets include `configure`, `release`, `debug`, `relwithdebinfo`, `test`,  and `clean`. Refer to the Wiki for a full list of supported features.
