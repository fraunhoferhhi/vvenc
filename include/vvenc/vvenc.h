/**
  \ingroup VVEncExternalInterfaces
  The class HhiVvcEnc provides the encoder's user interface. The simplest way to use the encoder is to call init() to initialize an encoder instance with the
  the given VVEncCfg. After initialization the encoding of the video is performed by using the encode() method to hand over frame by frame in display order
  and retrieve the compressed bitstream chunks of already processed pictures. The encoding can be end by calling flush() that causes the encoder to finish encoding of all pending pictures.
  Finally calling uninit() releases all allocated resources held by the encoder internally.
  Beside the basic functionality of encoding there are some more methods available.
  For instance, the reconfig() is used to reconfigure a running encoder. There are also method providing some service functionality like getting or printing encoder configuration,
  or getting information about the encoder or it's current state.
  The HhiVvcEnc also provides a static call that used the encoder as remote support client for joint encoding on two machines.
