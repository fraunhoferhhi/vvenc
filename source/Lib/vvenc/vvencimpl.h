  \ingroup VVEncExternalInterfaces
  The class HhiVvcDec provides the decoder user interface. The simplest way to use the decoder is to call init() to initialize an decoder instance with the
  the given VVCDecoderParameters. After initialization the decoding of the video is performed by using the decoder() method to hand over compressed packets (bitstream chunks) in decoding order
  and retrieve uncompressed pictures. The decoding can be end by calling flush() that causes the decoder to finish decoding of all pending packets.
  Finally calling uninit() releases all allocated resources held by the decoder internally.
